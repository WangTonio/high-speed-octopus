VoyDemo is a demo app, powered by libVoyager. Alls it does is connects to the nearest Bluetooth OBD device, and starts polling RPM and speed data repeatedly. It shows that data, and other messages to the main screen for the user to see. 

Requires: ELM327 Compatible Bluetooth OBD adapter. 

Check out this project, along with libVoyager. make sure and add libVoyager as a project library. You may also need to add a linked source folder to the buildpath of VoyDemo that points to the libvoyager/src directory on your local machine. The resulting .project file should resemble .project-sample in the project root directory.
